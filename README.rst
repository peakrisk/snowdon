This project is named after the highest mountain in Wales, `Snowdon`_
in the Snowdonia national park.

It is also intended as a reference to `Edward Snowden`_.  

It is not possible to understand cyber risk without an appreciation of
the material that Snowden revealed to the world.

He has shown how completely and utterly broken cyber security is in
the modern world.

Not that Edward spells his name with an **e** not an **o**.   *E* is
for Espionage, *O* is for Open.

It is hoped that this cyber risk model will in time help organisations
develop better cyber security practices.
